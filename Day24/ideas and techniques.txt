apply algorithm on all 14-digit numbers from 99999999999999 on down
-very very long runtime

determine equations moving forward
-need to split every time eql lines occur
-could try to see if possible each time?

determine solutions moving backward
-division instructions seem very tough. may create another parallel universe scenario
- example: [a,0,0,2] after div w z means that w could have been 2a or 2a + 1
- worse ex: [2, 0, 0, a] after div w x means w could have been 2a, 2a+1, ..., 3a-1

determine solution by doing a partial derivative approach
-try tweaking each digit to see if it moves zf closer to 0 or further, tweak other way. if local min with digit, move on to next digit.
-issue is that this requires continuous functions(?) and mod and eql aren't those
